# flood-it

a basic game of FloodIt - click on tiles with the goal of making the board one color in a certain number of moves relative to size of the board and the number of different color. Implemented BigBang, loop structure, recursive data, array list and double dispatch. 

In this game, I pair programmed using Northeastern University's GameWorld libary. These were all methods done in the classes, and we tested the methods by checkExpects which use Northeastern University's Tester libary. I was the lead programmer for the base code & interface.
