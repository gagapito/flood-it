# Flood It Game

A basic game of FloodIt - click on tiles with the goal of making the board one color in a certain number of moves relative to size of the board and the number of different color.

## Game Information
Implemented BigBang, loop structure, recursive data, array list and double dispatch. 

In this game, I pair programmed using Northeastern University's GameWorld libary. These were all methods done in the classes, and we tested the methods by checkExpects which use Northeastern University's Tester libary. I was the lead programmer for the base code & interface.

**NOTE:** The code is dependent on Northeastern's Game Library and is therefore not runnable on other devices. 

## Purpose

The purpose of putting this project on my GitHub is to demostrate my ability to code in Java. The game uses class implementation, list, radio functions based on user input and templates. In addition there is extensive testing on this project to demonstrate my ability to test all types of cases including edge ones. 

This project was created for an assignment for the class CS 2500 - Fundamentals of Computer Science 2.
